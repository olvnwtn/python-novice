    "\n",
    "1.  [`list('some string')`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) converts a string into a list containing all of its characters.\n",
    "2.  [`join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) returns a string that is the *concatenation*\n",

    "    what is the most negative index that can safely be used with it,\n",
    "    and what location does that index represent?\n",
    "3.  If `values` is a list, what does `del values[-1]` do?\n",
    "4.  How can you display all elements but the last one without changing `values`?\n",
    "    (Hint: you will need to combine slicing and negative indexing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The program prints `m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Python interprets a negative index as starting from the end (as opposed to\n",
    "    starting from the beginning). The last element is `-1`.\n",
    "2.  The last index that can safely be used with a list of N elements is element\n",
    "    `-N`, which represents the first element.\n",
    "3.  `del values[-1]` removes the last element from the list.\n",
    "4.  `values[:-1]`\n",

    "furn\n",
    "eniroulf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `stride` is the step size of the slice.\n",
    "2.  The slice `1::2` selects all even-numbered items from a collection: it starts\n",
    "    with element `1` (which is the second element, since indexing starts at `0`),\n",
    "    goes on until the end (since no `end` is given), and uses a step size of `2`\n",

    "## Slice Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the following program print?\n",
