    "\n",
    "A [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) is a collection of [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html);\n",
    "The DataFrame is the way Pandas represents a table, and Series is the data-structure\n",
    "Pandas use to represent a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of the [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) library, which in practice means that\n",
    "most of the methods defined for Numpy Arrays apply to Pandas Series/DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Pandas so attractive is the powerful interface to access individual records\n",
    "of the table, proper handling of missing values, and relational-databases operations\n",
    "between DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting values\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a value at the position `[i,j]` of a DataFrame, we have two options, depending on\n",
    "what is the meaning of `i` in use.\n",
    "Remember that a DataFrame provides an *index* as a way to identify the rows of the table;\n",
    "a row, then, has a *position* inside the table as well as a *label*, which\n",
    "uniquely identifies its *entry* in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let’s go through this piece of code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "first = pd.read_csv('data/gapminder_all.csv', index_col='country')\n",

    "Try printing this expression! Can you print also its individual True/False elements?\n",
    "(hint: first assign the expression to a variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "fourth = third.drop('continent', axis = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we apply the drop function, but in this case we are dropping not a row but a whole column.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For each column in `data`, `idxmin` will return the index value corresponding to each column’s minimum;\n",
    "`idxmax` will do accordingly the same for each column’s maximum value.\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "data.loc[:,'gdpPercap_1985':]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is smart enough to recognize the number at the end of the column label and does not give you an error, although no column named `gdpPercap_1985` actually exists. This is useful if new columns are added to the CSV file later.\n",

    "4:\n",
