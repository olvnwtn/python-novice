    "1.  What’s wrong in this example?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "result = print_time(11, 37, 59)\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_time(hour, minute, second):\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  After fixing the problem above, explain why running this example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "result = print_time(11, 37, 59)\n",
    "print('result of call is:', result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "``` output\n",
    "11:37:59\n",
    "result of call is: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Why is the result of the call `None`?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The problem with the example is that the function `print_time()` is defined *after* the call to the function is made. Python\n",
    "    doesn’t know how to resolve the name `print_time` since it hasn’t been defined yet and will raise a `NameError` e.g.,\n",
    "    `NameError: name 'print_time' is not defined`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The first line of output `11:37:59` is printed by the first line of code, `result = print_time(11, 37, 59)` that binds the value\n",
    "    returned by invoking `print_time` to the variable `result`. The second line is from the second print call to print the contents\n",
    "    of the `result` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  `print_time()` does not explicitly `return` a value, so it automatically returns `None`.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `2003/2/1`\n",
    "2.  We saw examples of using *named arguments* when working with the pandas library. For example, when reading in a dataset\n",
    "    using `data = pd.read_csv('data/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv', index_col='country')`, the last argument `index_col` is a\n",
    "    named argument.\n",
    "3.  Using named arguments can make code more readable since one can see from the function call what name the different arguments\n",
