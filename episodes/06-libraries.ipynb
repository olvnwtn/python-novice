    "## Exploring the Math Module\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What function from the `math` module can you use to calculate a square root\n",
    "    *without* using `sqrt`?\n",
    "2.  Since the library contains this function, why does `sqrt` exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Using `help(math)` we see that we’ve got `pow(x,y)` in addition to `sqrt(x)`,\n",
    "    so we could use `pow(x, 0.5)` to find a square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The `sqrt(x)` function is arguably more readable than `pow(x, 0.5)` when\n",
    "    implementing equations. Readability is a cornerstone of good programming, so it\n",
    "    makes sense to provide a special function for this specific common case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the design of Python’s `math` library has its origin in the C standard,\n",
    "which includes both `sqrt(x)` and `pow(x,y)`, so a little bit of the history\n",
    "of programming is showing in Python’s function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locating the Right Module\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to select a random character from a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "bases = 'ACTTGCTTGAC'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Which [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) module could help you?\n",
    "2.  Which function would you select from that module? Are there alternatives?\n",
    "3.  Try to write a program that uses the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The [random module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) seems like it could help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string has 11 characters, each having a positional index from 0 to 10.\n",
    "You could use the [`random.randrange`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange)\n",
    "or [`random.randint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint) functions\n",
    "to get a random integer between 0 and 10, and then select the `bases` character at that index:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from random import randrange\n",
    "\n",
    "random_index = randrange(len(bases))\n",
    "print(bases[random_index])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or more compactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from random import randrange\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bases[randrange(len(bases))])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you found the [`random.sample`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample) function?\n",
    "It allows for slightly less typing but might be a bit harder to understand just by reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from random import sample\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sample(bases, 1)[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this function returns a list of values. We will learn about\n",
    "lists in [episode 11](11-lists.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and shortest solution is the [`random.choice`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice)\n",
    "function that does exactly what we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from random import choice\n",
    "\n",
    "print(choice(bases))\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Jigsaw Puzzle (Parson’s Problem) Programming Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearrange the following statements so that a random\n",
    "DNA base is printed and its index in the string.\n",
    "Not all statements may be needed. Feel free to use/add\n",
    "intermediate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "bases=\"ACTTGCTTGAC\"\n",
    "import math\n",
    "import random\n",

    "___ = len(bases)\n",
    "print(\"random base \", bases[___], \"base index\", ___)\n",
    "```\n",

    "2.  Rewrite the program so that it uses `import` *without* `as`.\n",
    "3.  Which form do you find easier to read?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import math as m\n",
    "angle = ____.degrees(____.pi / 2)\n",
    "print(____)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Since you just wrote the code and are familiar with it, you might actually\n",
    "find the first version easier to read. But when trying to read a huge piece\n",
    "of code written by someone else, or when getting back to your own huge piece\n",
    "of code after several months, non-abbreviated names are often easier, except\n",

    "## There Are Many Ways To Import Libraries!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  `print(\"sin(pi/2) =\", sin(pi/2))`\n",
    "2.  `print(\"sin(pi/2) =\", m.sin(m.pi/2))`\n",
    "3.  `print(\"sin(pi/2) =\", math.sin(math.pi/2))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Library calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `from math import sin, pi`\n",
    "2.  `import math`\n",
    "3.  `import math as m`\n",
    "4.  `from math import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Library calls 1 and 4. In order to directly refer to `sin` and `pi` without\n",
    "    the library name as prefix, you need to use the `from ... import ...`\n",
    "    statement. Whereas library call 1 specifically imports the two functions\n",
    "    `sin` and `pi`, library call 4 imports all functions in the `math` module.\n",
    "2.  Library call 3. Here `sin` and `pi` are referred to with a shortened library\n",
    "    name `m` instead of `math`. Library call 3 does exactly that using the\n",
    "    `import ... as ...` syntax - it creates an alias for `math` in the form of\n",
    "    the shortened name `m`.\n",
    "3.  Library call 2. Here `sin` and `pi` are referred to with the regular library\n",
    "    name `math`, so the regular `import ...` call suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** although library call 4 works, importing all names from a module using a wildcard\n",
    "import is [not recommended](https://pep8.org/#imports) as it makes it unclear which names from the module\n",
    "are used in the code. In general it is best to make your imports as specific as possible and to\n",
    "only import what your code uses. In library call 1, the `import` statement explicitly tells us\n",
    "that the `sin` function is imported from the `math` module, but library call 4 does not\n",
    "convey this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Specific Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Fill in the blanks so that the program below prints `90.0`.\n",
    "2.  Do you find this version easier to read than preceding ones?\n",
    "3.  Why *wouldn’t* programmers always use this form of `import`?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "____ math import ____, ____\n",
    "angle = degrees(pi / 2)\n",
    "print(angle)\n",

    "print(angle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most likely you find this version easier to read since it’s less dense.\n",
    "The main reason not to use this form of import is to avoid name clashes.\n",
    "For instance, you wouldn’t import `degrees` this way if you also wanted to\n",
    "use the name `degrees` for a variable or function of your own. Or if you\n",
